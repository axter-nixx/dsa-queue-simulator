# DSA-QUEUE-SIMULATOR

Developed a real time traffic analyzing system where a simulation of traffic at a junction is visualized with graphics so that the traffic can be managed from the system we developed and this simulation is also an example to show that it can be applicable in the real life world. In the following program i developed 2 main programs called **simulator.c** and **traffic_generator.c** where simulator.c is the logic to manage the data and has the graphics libraries in it and traffic_generator.c is the program that generates the traffic data like vehicle number plate,road and lane and stores the data into vehicle.data and that file is used by simulator.c to simulate the traffic into the traffic junction. Here, I used the concept of queue and priority queue for the management of traffic system and **sdl2 libraries** for the graphical feature to my program. The vehicle logics that I used in this program is, theres this lane called **AL2** where, if the vehicles number exceed than 10 in that lane then, all other lane which is being served will be halted and the AL2 lane will be prioritized to serve its vehicle first, implementing the concept of priority queue in it. When the vehicle number is below 10 in the lane AL2 then all the **4 lanes** are served as normal lanes and the cycle of traffic light goes in a normal way. Vehicles are served based on the average number of vehicles waiting in normal lanes. To calculate the estimated time of green light in a lane will be the product of number of vehicles in the lane and the estimated time to serve one vehicle.
