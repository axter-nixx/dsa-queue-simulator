This program uses the fundamentals of queue and priority queue to develop a traffic management system where a traffic junction connects two major roads, forming a central point where vehicles must choose one of three alternative paths to continue


#Things that i used on building traffic_generator.> [!CAUTION]
time.h header file and unistd.h 
time for sleep() to assign the vehicles to arrive at a specific interval 
unistd to generator the random number so that it can be used to assign the cars a random id(color) and lane
